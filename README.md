# CM Workspace

Change-management working tools, packaged as a Claude Code plugin.

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `cm-proposal-generator` | **v0.1 (MVP)** — RFP + client inputs → a CM proposal deck, populated from a knowledge bank |
| `cm-effort-estimation` | Pursuit-side effort and pricing estimator — reads an RFP scope, benchmarks it against past project quotes, and outputs a priced schedule of deliverables |

## Proposal generator (v0.1, MVP)

Takes an RFP (plus briefing notes, stakeholder lists, whatever else the client sent) and
produces a first-draft change-management proposal deck, written from the firm's own
knowledge bank.

Five stages, each writing an inspectable artifact so a run can be resumed or audited from
any point:

```
RFP + client inputs ─▶ rfp_brief.json ─▶ proposal_plan.json ─▶ proposal.html ─▶ qa_report.md
      INTAKE              PLAN + RETRIEVE          BUILD              QA
```

Stage 4 has two render targets off the same plan: a self-contained **HTML deck** on a
generic business template (the current default, for proof of concept) and a **.pptx** on
an approved PowerPoint template (the eventual target). Both validate against the same
template profile, so switching changes nothing upstream.

Two invariants the QA stage enforces mechanically, and the reason the intermediate
artifacts exist at all:

- **Provenance** — every content block traces to a knowledge-bank entry ID or carries an
  explicit `[GAP]` marker. There's no third state, so an invented claim can't hide among
  real credentials.
- **Coverage** — every requirement extracted from the RFP maps to a section, and an
  uncovered mandatory requirement fails the run rather than being quietly dropped.

### Try it

A complete worked example ships in `examples/acme-erp/` — fictional client, invented RFP:

```bash
python skills/cm-proposal-generator/scripts/render_html.py \
    examples/acme-erp/proposal_plan.json \
    proposal-assets/templates/html-generic -o /tmp/acme/proposal.html

python skills/cm-proposal-generator/scripts/qa_deck.py \
    examples/acme-erp/rfp_brief.json examples/acme-erp/proposal_plan.json \
    -o /tmp/acme/qa_report.md
```

12 slides, 8/8 requirements covered, 1 open `[GAP]`. See that folder's README for what
each part demonstrates.

### Setup before real use

1. **Fill the knowledge bank** at `proposal-assets/knowledge-bank/` — see the README
   there, and delete the `*-EXAMPLE.md` format exemplars so they can't be retrieved into a
   real bid. A thin bank produces a deck full of `[GAP]`s, which is correct behaviour: it
   reports what the firm hasn't written down yet.
2. **Drop the firm's approved template** into `proposal-assets/templates/` when switching
   off the PoC HTML renderer — see the README there. The skill will stop and ask rather
   than build a lookalike.

### What v0.1 does not do

Pricing calculation, multi-lot bids, semantic search over the bank (retrieval is literal
tag matching), and automated OOXML assembly — `build_deck.py` validates and sequences the
build, then the `pptx` skill's template workflow executes it. Output is always a **draft
for practitioner review**, never a submission-ready document.

## Pursuit estimating tool

`skills/cm-effort-estimation/assets/cm-effort-estimator.html` is a single self-contained
page — open it in any browser, no install, no server, no network calls. It parses .docx
and .pdf scope documents in the browser, reads scope drivers out of them (impacted
headcount, business units, countries, languages, waves, duration, training modules,
class-size caps), and prices a schedule of CM deliverables against an editable table of
your past project quotes. Day rates and effort-per-unit are medians of your own history
indexed to the current year; anything without history falls back to a standard assumption
and is labelled as such. Scope the tender asks to be quoted as an option is detected and
subtotalled separately, outside the headline total. Exports the priced schedule to CSV or
Markdown, and prints to PDF.

Effort comes from `assets/hours-library.csv` — 189 costed tasks across 53 deliverables,
imported from the firm's itemised CM deliverables workbook. Each task is typed by archetype
and complexity rather than estimated individually, so editing one cell of that 8 × 3 matrix
reprices every task that uses it. Tasks can be excluded or overridden per pursuit, and the
deliverable's effort — and its price — follow immediately. Past quotes stay in charge of day
rates; the library is in charge of hours.

The built-in sample scope, `assets/sample-rfp-change-management.txt`, is an anonymised
public-sector change management and training requirement specification — all party names
removed — and doubles as the regression case for the detection and pricing logic. It is a
useful test precisely because it specifies a full CM and training scope while stating
almost no numbers, so most drivers surface as flagged assumptions rather than reads.

Scripts are stdlib-only and each runs standalone with `--help`.

## Installing on another machine

**Option A — direct install:** copy this folder to the other machine and point Claude Code
at it as a plugin source (a local path or a git remote).

**Option B — via the marketplace listing:** this folder includes
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, so once pushed to a git repository others can run:

```
/plugin marketplace add <your-repo-url>
```

then install the `cm-workspace` plugin from that marketplace.

⚠️ **Caveat on `marketplace.json`**: it was built from general Claude Code plugin
conventions rather than a verified schema reference. Test the install on a second machine
(or a fresh Claude Code profile) before relying on it for distribution.
